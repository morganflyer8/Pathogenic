     When young adolescent women subscribe to culturally determined fashion expectations, they run the risk of succumbing to pathogenic dieting methods.
     In the early part of the 21st century, the photographs, stories, and symbols reinforced through advertising, social media, television and film promote the concept of thinness.
     This trope affects a womenâ€™s medical wellbeing and can lead to pathogenic eating disorder, most notably anorexia.
     This project examines the triggers within contemporary fashion that de-stabilizes the self-perception of young adolescent women.
